# Planned documents folder
Anything you see in the PLANDOC folder describe features yet to be implemented in the Ice Moon engine. These features may appear sometime in the future, and these documents may move to the DOC folder when it happens. The planned documents are worded as if they are already features in the game, though they are not. They also are potentially unfinished and don't fully reflect its soon-to-be final version.

Some of the planned features may be referenced in documents in the DOC folder, but not explained in great detail.
